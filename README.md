# Threat Asserter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaggernod/threatasserter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaggernod/threatasserter)
=================

Annotation-based thread assertion.

As a mobile developer we do tend to be punished by performing long running tasks (>16ms) on a Ui Thread.
Android platform does not restrict us from doing so and it is easy with time to run into a junky Ui.

We can assert on which thread are we operating but this does dilute the expressiveness of our code.

Now instead of adding checks inside our methods just add `@AssertWorkerThread` and in `debug` build type
the code will throw exception pointing at the culprit and explaining the cause.

You can also assert Main Thread with`@AssertMainThread` as sometimes it is hard to see if you are really performing 
UI related work on a UI thread. 


```java
@AssertMainThread
public static void onClickWithWorkerThreadHelper(Context context) {
  Toast.makeText(context,  "Won't be displayed as will crash before.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
```

Works as well in a Kotlin project.
```kotlin
@AssertWorkerThread
fun crashIfNotWorkerThread() {
  // Looong task. But will crash before getting here.
  SystemClock.sleep(1000)
  }
```

The logging will only happen in debug builds and the annotation itself is never present in the
compiled class file for any build type. This means you can keep the annotation and check it into
source control. It has zero effect on non-debug builds.

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.jaggernod:threatasserter-plugin:1.0.7'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'threatasserter'
```

Disable logging temporarily by adding the following:

```groovy
threatAsserter {
    enabled true
}
```

Local Development
-----------------

 * `install` - Install plugin, runtime, and annotations into local repo.
 * `connectedDebugAndroidTest` - Build and runs the connected Android Tests on a device. Normal `connectedCheck` won't succeed as it is the release build.
